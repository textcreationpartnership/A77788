         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a generall Scandall, (upon what grounds I know not) thrown upon the Profeſſours of the Law, (eſpecially in this age, that the practicall knowledge of the Lawes of God, and of
<pb facs="tcp:170165:3"/>our own Nation, do ſeldome meet together in one perſon; whereby they ſeem to put an incompatibility of devotion and ſanctity, into the life of Lawyers: whereas Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is ſutable with all ſorts of vocations, and he that is not <hi>Bonus Theologus,</hi> as to himſelf, and that does not make Religion his <hi>Primum,</hi> and his <hi>Ultimum,</hi> can never be well fitted for any Profeſsion whatſoever. It is true in the Creation, God commanded the Plants, to bring forth their fruits, every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its kind; and ſo he commands all Chriſtians, who are living Plants of his Church, to bring forth fruits of Devotion, every one in his
<pb facs="tcp:170165:3"/>quality, and vocation. For at ought to be differently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by different men, and the practice of it, muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the capacity, and imployments of each particular perſon, and when Religion is not ſutable with the lawfull vocation of any man, then without doubt, that Religion is falſe: For true Godlineſſe, is ſo farr from prejudicing any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, that it adorns, and beautifies it: all perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more acceptable in their vocation, joyning it with true devotion. And as knowledge is the glory of a man, ſo Divine knowledge is the glory of a Chriſtian;
<pb facs="tcp:170165:4"/>eſpecially that of ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, and makes a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an happy to ſalvation. The Brick, and Straw of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is not comparable to the Gold, and Silver Veſſels in the Temple; neither are Divine Inſtructions borrowed from Humane Learning, to be compared with the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable value of thoſe golden Precepts contained in holy Scriptures. For this cauſe, my Lord, have I linckt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether this Chain of Golden Sentences, out of the holy Scriptures, and gathered this handfull of Flowers, out of that Garden of Paradiſe, to preſent to your Lordſhips
<pb facs="tcp:170165:4"/>hands, which if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip pleaſe ſometimes to ſmell unto, I doubt not but they may yeeld ſome fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy and ſweetneſſe. For the written Word of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords extraordinary ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, chearing a breaſt full of perplexities, &amp; the power of it reforming the diſordered lives of men, and ſnatching us from the gates of death, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. And ſince God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Old Teſtament commands us, and Chriſt in the New enjoyns us, to read his holy Word, and to ſearch the Scripture; I have therefore in the firſt place, made choice of thoſe places of Scripture, that concern our hearing,
<pb facs="tcp:170165:5"/>and reading the word of God; the knowledge of which, fully underſtood, and conſcionably practiſed, is, or ſhould be the main, and principall end of every true Chriſtians endeavour. I have likewiſe obſerved the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall texts concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Books, mentioned in Scripture, and the difference betwixt the Old and New Teſtament, and of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity of the Virtue, and the Benefits of Prayer. And that we may with more eaſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt thoſe inconveniencies and diſtreſſes, which we have been acquainted with, and which do daily threaten worſe unto us. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:170165:5"/>produced ſeverall Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures concerning afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the benefit of them, if ſeriouſly conſidered: For how can a man ſuffer his heart to be dejected at the privation of any temporall bleſſings, or at the load of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflictions which God ſhall lay upon him, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the vanity of the firſt, &amp; Gods Juſtice in impoſing the laſt; and that nothing is worth his ſerious thoughts, but what may accompany him to the Manſions of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Certainly, if we ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reflect upon the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our own nature, and think upon that happy eſtate which we ſhall arrive unto,
<pb facs="tcp:170165:6"/>if we make the Law of God our meditation, day, and night, we ſhall then wean, and take off our affections from this world, the cares whereof do very much clog our ſouls flight to heaven, and tedder us here below. I muſt confeſſe, proſperity is a great bleſsing of God, and duely uſed, is no mean ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, both to ones ſelf, and others; yet if the hand that gave, ſhall take away, we muſt not repine, at what God formerly lent us, and thinks not fit any longer to permit us the uſe of. In the next place, ſince our whole life ought to be a continuall preparation for death, I have
<pb facs="tcp:170165:6"/>collected many meditations concerning it. And ſince, to perform any action well, a man muſt propoſe the end of that action to himſelf; and ſince, of all mans actions the government of himſelf, in relation to his future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, is moſt important, and neerlieſt concerning him; a mans being in this life, being but inſtrumentally good, as being the means for him to be well in the next. I have in the laſt place, obſerved ſome things concerning the day of Judgement, and the happineſſe we expect in the life to come. For there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains an eternity to us, after the ſhort revolution of time,
<pb facs="tcp:170165:7"/>we ſo ſwiftly run over here on earth, and all that which in this world we call happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is not valuable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the future, nor is any thing we do here, conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, otherwiſe then as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to our eternall well-being hereafter. And thus having given your Lordſhip an account of this ſmall Tract, I muſt beg your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips pardon, for putting your name in the Front of it: being I fear an undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Lordſhip to prefix your name to ſo ſlender a piece: but it being a right hand errour, I hope it will be lookt upon the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably by your Lordſhip
<pb facs="tcp:170165:7"/>my obligations to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip being ſo many, &amp; great, that I am bereft of all other means of ſhewing my thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, but by laying hold of any opportunity of ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing my ſelf</p>

<note place="margin">

                  <p>The New Teſtament, or the Goſpel, ſheweth unto us our happy eſtate and condition we are in, by grace, by the merits, death, and paſſion, Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and aſcenſion of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>For now is Chriſt riſen from the dead,

                  <p>For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the Reſurrection of the dead.</p>

                  <p>For as by one mans diſobedience,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170165:44"/>many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous.</p>

                  <p>That as ſin hath reigned unto death, even ſo might grace reign through righteouſneſſe, by leſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, In the Old Teſtament we have many Prophecies, and foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Chriſt our Saviour to come.</p>
                  <p>In the new Teſtament, or Goſpel, we have the joyfull newes, and glad tidings, of the birth of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>And there were in the ſame country ſhepheards, abiding in the field,

                  <p>And lo, the Angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord ſhone round about them, and they were ſore afraid.</p>
                  <p>And the Angel ſaid unto them, fear

                  <p>For unto you is born this day, in the city of <hi>David,</hi> a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And his name was called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which was ſo named, of the Angel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was conceived in the wombe.</p>
                  <p>Behold,
<note place="margin">

                  <p>And ſhe ſhall bring forth a ſon, and thou ſhalt call his name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</p>
                  <p>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled, which was ſpoken of the Lord, by the Prophet, ſaying,</p>

                  <p>And the word was made fleſh,

                  <p>The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is death.</p>

                  <p>The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law.</p>

                  <p>Death, as one obſerveth, is a quiet ſleep, The ſoul, when death comes, puts off the body, and the body buried, lives in the earth, the grave being the bed thereof: there to remain till the

                  <p>It is obſerved by one, That the true ſervants of God are ſo farr from being any wayes diſcontented, or troubled with the thinking of death, as that they rather earneſtly deſire, and thirſt after it, with a <hi>Cupio diſſolvi,</hi>

                     </label> The reaſon why there is to be a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Iudgement of the bodies and ſouls reunited, is this.</p>
                  <p>The ſoul receiveth the firſt Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being the firſt, and principall actour in ſin; and then the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quickned by the ſoul, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, and aſſociated with the ſame, in the acting of ſin: and in this reſpect it is requiſite, that there ſhould be a ſecond Iudgement, when both body and ſoul might together receive their Iudgement, as they had been both of them joynt actours in ſin.</p>
                  <p>And this may ſerve to anſwer an Objection which may be made of ſome ſhew of injuſtice, to be twice puniſhed by two Iudgements, for one and the ſame ſin.</p>

                  <p>Again, at our appearance there, we ſhall be naked, and where we ſhall be manifeſted, even all our actions, words, and thoughts, not only which in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but alſo, the <hi>abſcondita tenebraru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> even the very hidden, and ſecret things of darkneſſe, ſhall be then clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted: Gods books ſhall then be laid open: as appeareth <hi>Revelation</hi> 20.12.

And this may ſerve for an Anſwer to an Objection, how our thoughts ſhould then be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted.</p>
                  <p>Again, a reaſon of the neceſſity of the ſecond Judgement, when the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall not onely receive the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of joy, of, <hi>Come ye bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c. but of praiſe likewiſe, <hi>Well done good and faithfull ſervant.</hi> And the wicked ſhall not onely then receive the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of torment, of, <hi>Go ye curſed,</hi> &amp;c. but alſo of ſhame, as bad as the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>As touching this day of Iudgement,
<note place="margin">Uſe fro ſimilitude drawn from thunder, and applied to the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> it is obſerved; That as thunder ſtrike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one being aſleep, killeth him, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his eyes open; but thoſe it ſtriketh waking, it killeth them, leaving their eyes ſhut: even ſo, in the day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thoſe which are then found ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely ſleeping in their ſins, and in the pleaſures of this world, they ſhall then have their naturall life taken from them; that is, by ſentence, and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pronounced againſt them; they ſhall be caſt into Hell fire, yet with their eyes open: that is, They ſhall perpetually ſee, feel, and enjoy the endleſſe torments of hell fire.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe, contrariwiſe, which are then found waking, that is, thoſe elect children of God, continually expecting the ſame, being alwaies ready, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, with oyl in their lamps, (the oyl of faith) to attend the bridegroom at his coming, evermore rejoycing at the expectation of the laſt ſound of the trumpet; thoſe I ſay, although they be deprived of this their naturall life, yet

                  <p>Next, as touching the Iudge, before whom we muſt appear, being Chriſt, our Saviour. For as he came firſt in humility, to be judged; ſo then ſhall he come triumphing, in his glory, to be a Iudge, both of quick and dead. And then ſhall they which were his judges and executioners, behold him in all his glory, who deſpiſed him in his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: and they ſhall then be all judged by him.
